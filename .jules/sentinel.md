## 2026-02-22 - Hidden IDOR in Unused Endpoint
**Vulnerability:** IDOR in `/reports/{report_id}/pdf` endpoint allowed unauthenticated access to any report PDF.
**Learning:** The endpoint was not used by the frontend (which uses `window.print()`), making it a 'shadow API' that was easily overlooked during security reviews.
**Prevention:** Regularly audit all exposed API endpoints, even those not actively used by the frontend. Use automated tools to enumerate and test all defined routes.
